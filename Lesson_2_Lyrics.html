            I'm on my 14 carats, I'm 14 carat
            Doing it up like Midas, mm
            Now you say I got a touch so good, so good
            Make you never wanna leave
            So don't (so don't), so don't (so don't)
            
            Gonna wear that dress you like skin-tight
            Do my hair up real, real nice
            And syncopate my skin to your heart beating
            
            'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
            I just wanna look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
            Let me show you how proud I am to be yours, leave this dress a mess on the floor
            Still look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
            
            I'm in my marquise diamonds, I'm a marquise diamond
            Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mm
            You say I give it to you hard, so bad, so bad
            Make you never wanna leave
            I won't (I won't), I won't (I won't)
            
            Gonna wear that dress you like skin-tight
            Do my hair up real, real nice
            And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing
            
            'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
            I just wanna look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
            Let me show you how proud I am to be yours, leave this dress a mess on the floor
            Still look good for you, good for you, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
            
            Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
            Oh
            
            Trust me, I can take you there
            Trust me, I can take you there
            Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I (whoo)
            
            Hold up, take a minute, love (hold up, take a minute, love)
            'Cause I ain't tryna fuck your image up (tryna fuck your image up)
            More than likely mess around in triple cuffs, stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
            Pants sag like I don't give a-
            
            I ain't tryna fuck your business up (I ain't tryna fuck your business up)
            And I ain't tryna get you into stuff (tryna get you into stuff)
            But the way you touchin' on me in the club, rubbin' on my miniature
            John Hancock, fuck a signature (oh)
            
            Anytime I hit it, know she finna fall through
            And every time we get up, always end up on the news
            Ain't worried 'bout no press, and ain't worried 'bout the next bitch
            They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
            
            Jackpot, hit the jackpot (whoo)
            Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots (whoo)
            You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
            You look good, girl, I bet it feel good, don't it?
            
            I just wanna look good for you, good for you, oh-oh
            Baby, let me be good to you, good to you, oh-oh
            Let me show you how proud I am to be yours, leave this dress a mess on the floor
            Still look good for you, good for you, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
            
            Oh-oh, oh-oh
            Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
